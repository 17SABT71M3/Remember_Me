This is the `doskey` file for that macro . I run notepad, Create files from the command line itself
<br>I would like a better preview of the work I have done. Let's say I am in a folder and I run the
<br>command. Now I move to another folder, and i run that same command using up and down arrow keys
<br>which is the command history. Ex- `notepad du.bat` . Now, the problem is that batch file does not
<br>exist in that folder. It might exist in another folder which i dont remember or is too long to type
<br>There in comes this bat file. When u include this in your CMD macro, whenever u run notepad
<br>it will save the location of files in a list. It will reference this list, next time u run the 
<br>the same command and are looking for the file. It asks u , whether u want to search for filenames
<br>or u can choose to create a new file by that name. Please use it to understand what I am talking about
<br>Good luck!
